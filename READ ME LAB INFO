For all my labs i used python debugger to run my code with breakpoints and step ins
that's why all my labs are in one file.
I had commented out assignments as I finished them, but I went back and tried to uncomment
all my code in the labs as they were in zylabs. I've checked and it seems they all run,
but if i missed anything, I apologize Dr. Brash for any problem this may cause during code review
