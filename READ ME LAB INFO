For all my labs i used python debugger to run my code with breakpoints and step ins
that's why all my labs are in one file.
I had commented out assignments as I finished them, but I went back and tried to uncomment
all my code in the labs as they were in zylabs. I've checked and it seems they all run,
but if i missed anything, I apologize Dr. Brash for any problem this may cause during code review
In parallel to this course I am enrolled in a machine learning and data science class at William and Mary. 

I want to note that this class helped me out immensely when it came to understanding more about Python as I was accustomed to R
and I appreciate your work this semester to go beyond the core curriculum and apply real-life anecdotes. 
This helped me paint a better picture as I am applying to graduate schools in the fall in hopes of 
a M.S in Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science or Quantitive Economics and using my electives for data science courses.
